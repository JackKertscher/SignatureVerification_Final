Figures:
    Figure 1 (signature_pairs): Generated using visualize() function in modelTraining.ipynb
    Figure 2 (siamese): Created using Inkscape
    Figure 3 (verification_stats): Data gathered in modelTests.ipynb, visualized in Google sheets
    Figure 4 (augmented): Generated using code block at the end of modelExperimentation.ipynb

To try out our model, load best_model.keras in an environment with euclidean_dist() and loss() defined, as shown in modelTests.ipynb.
